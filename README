# LUDUM DARE FRAMEWORK #

# OVERVIEW #
This is a bare-bones framework for Ludum Dare competition entries.  Initially,
Linux and Windows are supported for sprite-based games.

There are no assets provided with the exception of possibly a logo for the
framework, the GPL logo, and a bitmap font for debug text or in-game text if
the user so desires to use it as such.

Any additions are welcome.  A roadmap document describing the goals in a long-
term format will be forthcoming.
